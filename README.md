# dots
my dotfiles.

# editor
I use `neovim`, with [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management. 
once you have both of these installed, just open neovim and run `:PlugUpdate` to get all the plugins 
installed.

# shell
I use `fish` for my terminal shell; along with [`fisher`](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to manage packages for it. once you've installed both of these, use fisher to install the gruvbox theme like so: `fisher add jomik/fish-gruvbox`.

# terminal
I use kitty, with very little modification. gruvbox theme is preset, as well as Fira Code for the font. make sure you have it installed.

# installing
simply copy the files in each subfolder to their appropriate location, either under `$HOME/.config/` or `$HOME`, depending on the program.
